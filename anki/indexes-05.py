## For loop
############

my_list = [1,9,3,8,5,7]

# Begin the loop
for number in my_list:
    # For each list item
    # Print out the following:
    print 2 * number


#### Q: Explain how a `for` loop works here
#### Q: Explain what the variable `number` is doing (see below)

#### Notes:
# A variable name follows the for keyword;
# it will be assigned the value of each list item in turn.
# Then in list_name designates list_name as the list the loop will work on.
# The line ends with a colon (:) and the indented code that follows it will
# be executed once per item in the list.
