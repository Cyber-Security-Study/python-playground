# Dictionaries
## Important notes!

### This Next Part is Key

A dictionary is similar to a list, but you **access values by looking up a key instead of an index**. A key can be any string or number. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces, like so:

    d = {'key1' : 1, 'key2' : 2, 'key3' : 3}

This is a dictionary called d with three key-value pairs. The key `key1` points to the value `1`, `key2` to `2`, and so on.

Dictionaries are great for things like phone books (pairing a name with a phone number), login pages (pairing an e-mail address with a username), and more!


### Other notes

It seems very similar to a `json` file!
